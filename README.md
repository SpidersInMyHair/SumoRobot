At the moment:
---------------
Compiles then waits for user to press a button. 
      (ATM this is skipped to make debugging easier - hence why the variable 'begin' = True). 
When user presses the button on EV3 brick - waits 3 seconds as required.
Then simply just alternates between "searching" and "charging".
